# DataStructures
This Repository will have programs to understand Data structures in java

1. **Stack**:
   Stack is a LIFO Data structure
    - stores objects in to a sort of "vertical tower"
    - push and pop are methods to insert and remove elements.
    - Uses of stack:
        1. undo/redo features in text editor
        2. moving back/forward through browser history
        3. backtracking algo's (maze, file directories)
        4. calling functions


2. **Queue**:
   FIFO data structure eg. line of people
    - linear data structure
    - add/offer and remove/poll are two method of adding and removing elements.
    - adding elements is called enqueuing and removing is called dequeue'ing.
    - Queue is an interface and cannot be instantiated so create a LinkedList
    - Uses of queue:
       1. Keyboard buffer(letters should appear on the screen in order they are passed )
       2. Printer Queue
       3. Used in LinkedList, PriorityQueues, BFS.
